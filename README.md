# Forest Admin in Nodejs (Express.js & Sequelize) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ForestAdmin/forest-express-sequelize.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ForestAdmin/forest-express-sequelize)

Forest is a modern Admin Interface (see the [live
demo](https://app.forestadmin.com/login?livedemo)) that works on all major web frameworks including Nodejs.

The main difference between *forest-express-sequelize* and other packages like *Active Admin* in Rails, *Django Admin* in Django or *Sonata* in Symfony is that *forest-express-sequelize* creates an Express middleware that automatically
generates a highly flexible admin REST API and deploys a WYSIWYG interface to <a href="https://www.forestadmin.com/">Forest Admin</a>.
